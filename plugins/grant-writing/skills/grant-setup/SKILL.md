name: grant-setup
description: Initialize a new research grant proposal project — folder structure, funding announcement ingestion, submission checklist, versioning schema, writing-style profile from prior grants, and interaction ground rules. Use this whenever the user says they are starting a new grant, proposal, R01/R21/K-award, NSF proposal, DoD white paper, or foundation application, mentions a funding opportunity announcement (FOA/NOFO/PA/RFA/BAA), asks to "set up" anything grant-related, or wants a GitHub repo / LaTeX project created for a proposal. Also use when another grant skill finds no project-config.md.

# Grant Project Setup

Set up the infrastructure for a grant proposal so every later stage (aims, budget, approach, review) has a consistent home. Run this once per proposal; it produces the `project-config.md` contract that all other grant skills depend on.

Scope check first: this suite supports single-project research grants, career awards, and fellowships from NIH, NSF, DoD, and US foundations. If the mechanism is a training grant (T32/T35), a multi-project program grant (P01/P50/U54, centers), a post-award document (RPPR, JIT), or a non-US funder, say so plainly — these are out of scope and half-supporting them misleads. Individual components (one project within a P01, a biosketch, a budget) can still use the matching skills, stated as such.

## Interaction ground rules (apply to this and every subsequent session)

Record these in the config so all future sessions honor them:

- Use rigorous, neutral scientific language in every interaction.
- Never flatter the user ("this is a great idea," "excellent"). State facts.
- Present strengths and weaknesses in neutral tones, each with a stated reason.
- Push back directly, with evidence, when a plan has a scientific or strategic weakness. A grant reviewer will not be polite; being candid now is the useful behavior.

## Step 1 — Gather the essentials

Ask the user for (accept partial answers; record gaps as open items):

1. **Funding announcement**: FOA/NOFO/PA/RFA/BAA number or URL, funder, mechanism (e.g., NIH R01, NSF CAREER, DoD CDMRP), due date. Fetch or copy the announcement text into `00_admin/foa/`. Extract into `00_admin/foa/foa-summary.md`: page limits, review criteria (quote them verbatim — later sections are drafted against them), budget cap, required documents, eligibility constraints, and any letter-of-intent or pre-application requirement with its own deadline (these often fall weeks before the full deadline and are the most commonly missed date; drafted with `grant-loi-preproposal`). The FOA overrides the agency's general guide wherever they differ; where the FOA is silent, verify against the current guide rather than memory.
2. **Eligibility and submission status**: confirm any career-stage, citizenship (common in DoD; required for NRSA fellowships and NSF GRFP), or institutional eligibility gates before drafting effort is spent — an eligibility miss voids everything else. Ask whether this is a new submission or a resubmission; if resubmission, put the prior reviews in `00_admin/foa/` and note that `grant-resubmission` runs alongside the drafting skills.
3. **Deadline map**: work backward from the sponsor deadline. Ask for the internal grants-office deadline — institutions typically require the complete application days before the sponsor date, so the internal date is the real deadline. Flag long-lead items now: subaward documents (need the partner institution's grants office to sign off), letters of support, biosketches/Other Support from external collaborators, and — for career-development awards and fellowships — referee letters, which referees submit themselves and are the least controllable dependency in the application. These routinely take 2–4 weeks and cannot be compressed at the end.
4. **Team**: PI(s), co-investigators, collaborators, institutions. Record who submits — an authorized institutional official via Grants.gov/ASSIST, Research.gov, eBRAP, or a foundation portal, almost never the PI personally — and confirm the PI has active credentials in that system (eRA Commons, SciENcv, etc.).
5. **Grant administration checklist**: Ask whether their sponsored programs / grants office provided one. If yes, copy it into `00_admin/`. If not, generate one from the FOA's required-documents list plus the agency defaults in `references/agency-checklists.md`, and label it clearly as auto-generated pending office confirmation.
6. **Document format**: Microsoft Word or LaTeX. Record the choice; it determines file templates and how approved text is inserted. Also ask which reference manager the team uses (Zotero, EndNote, Mendeley, or hand-maintained BibTeX for LaTeX) — citations live inside the manuscripts via the manager, not in a separate folder, and `grant-references` needs to know the toolchain to audit them. For multi-author documents, recommend a shared library (Zotero group library, EndNote shared library, or the `.bib` in the repo) — citations inserted from co-authors' personal libraries fragment on merge and produce duplicate bibliography entries. Also ask how the PI marks citations still to be added — every investigator has a habit: `(ref)`, `(PMID: 123456)`, `[ref: 123455]`, highlighting, `TODO` — and record it; `grant-references` and `grant-format-check` sweep for exactly this convention so no placeholder reaches submission.
7. **Storage location**: local folder, Google Drive, OneDrive, or a GitHub repository. Computational faculty writing NSF proposals commonly pair LaTeX with a GitHub repo as the shared home — if the user mentions either, ask about the other. For GitHub: record the repo URL, confirm it is **private**, and note how collaborators edit (direct commits, PRs, or Overleaf–GitHub sync). Storage choice determines the versioning mode in Step 3.

## Step 2 — Create the directory structure

```
<grant-short-name>/
├── 00_admin/            # config, checklist, FOA, decision log, version log
│   └── foa/
├── 01_aims/
├── 02_research_plan/    # significance, innovation, approach
├── 03_budget/
├── 04_biosketches/
├── 05_support_letters/
├── 06_abstracts_title/
├── 07_compliance/       # DMSP, human subjects, facilities, etc.
├── 08_final_assembly/   # assembled docs, audit reports, cover letter
└── 99_prior_grants/     # researcher's previous proposals (style corpus)
```

Adjust names to the mechanism (e.g., add `02_research_plan/broader_impacts/` for NSF), but keep the numbered ordering — it mirrors the workflow.

### GitHub repositories

Use the same structure at the repo root. Additionally:

- Add a `.gitignore` for LaTeX build artifacts (`*.aux`, `*.log`, `*.bbl`, `*.blg`, `*.out`, `*.synctex.gz`, `*.fls`, `*.fdb_latexmk`). Committing the compiled PDF is the user's choice — some teams commit it at status transitions so non-LaTeX collaborators can read without building; record the choice.
- Git access is repo-wide — per-folder permissions are impossible. Sensitive material therefore stays out of the repo: detailed budgets with salary data (`03_budget/`) and `99_prior_grants/` live in a local or drive folder unless the user explicitly accepts that all repo collaborators see them. Record where each excluded folder actually lives in the config.
- A `README.md` at repo root pointing to `00_admin/project-config.md` helps collaborators who arrive via GitHub rather than via these skills.

### Permissions (shared drives)

If the folder lives on Google Drive or OneDrive, the model usually cannot set permissions itself. Produce a concrete instruction list for the user instead:

- All investigators and collaborators: edit access to `01_aims/`, `02_research_plan/`, `06_abstracts_title/`
- Budget folder (`03_budget/`): PI + grants administrator only (salary data is sensitive)
- `99_prior_grants/`: PI only unless stated otherwise
- Grants office contact: access to `00_admin/` and `03_budget/`

If a Drive/OneDrive connector is available, offer to set these directly.

For GitHub, translate the same access tiers into collaborator invitations: investigators get write access; the grants office contact rarely works in GitHub, so plan to deliver budget and admin documents by another channel rather than adding them to the repo.

## Step 3 — Establish versioning

Record the versioning mode in the config and use it for every document. The mode follows the storage choice:

**Filename mode** (local, Drive, OneDrive): `<document>_v<NN>_<YYYY-MM-DD>_<status>.<ext>` — status ∈ `draft`, `internal`, `shared`, `final`. Increment `NN` each editing session; never overwrite an existing version. Log each new version in `00_admin/version-log.md` (file, date, one-line summary of changes).

**Git mode** (GitHub repo): git history *is* the version log — do not duplicate it with versioned filenames. Use stable filenames (`01_aims/specific-aims.tex`), commit at the end of each editing session with a message summarizing the change, and mark status transitions (`draft` → `internal` → `shared` → `final`) with annotated tags (e.g., `aims-internal-2026-07-12`) or the team's existing branch/PR convention. Never rewrite pushed history. Skip `version-log.md`; the decision log is still kept — commit messages record *what* changed, the decision log records *why*. Wherever another skill says "new version per the schema," in git mode that means a commit (plus a tag if the status changed).

## Step 4 — Build the style corpus → style profile

The profile needs the researcher's **writing voice**, not their unpublished ideas. Present the choice of source material and let the user decide — do not assume prior grants:

- **Preferred: already-public writing.** Published papers (especially first-author), review articles, and public grant text — funded-abstract text on NIH RePORTER, an awarded NSF abstract — capture voice fully while being public already, so no unpublished content is exposed. Recommend this as the default source.
- **The user's choice: prior/unpublished grants.** These are excellent voice samples, but before the user places anything unpublished in `99_prior_grants/`, state the data-path consideration plainly so the decision is informed (below). Some institutions have policies on putting unpublished research into external AI tools; the PI should confirm theirs.

**Data-path note to give the user (accurate, not alarmist).** Any file read here is sent to and processed on Anthropic's servers and retained for a window; whether it can also be used to improve future models depends on the account:

- On **commercial plans** (Claude for Work / Team / Enterprise, the API, Claude Gov): inputs and outputs are **not** used for model training by default; retention is short (≈30 days; Zero Data Retention available to qualified Enterprise accounts). Training exposure is effectively a non-issue.
- On **consumer plans** (Free / Pro / Max): content is used for training **only if the account has the model-improvement setting turned on** — a per-user choice; if it is off, chats are not used for training and retention is short. If it is on, content can persist (de-identified) in training pipelines for up to ~5 years.
- Regardless of the training setting, the content still leaves the user's machine and is processed by a third party — the relevant consideration for embargoed data, collaborator-confidential material, IP disclosures, or sponsor/institutional confidentiality. For those, prefer published sources or omit the sensitive passages.
- These are current as of the setup date and change; point the user to Anthropic's privacy settings and privacy center to confirm, and record their chosen source and any constraint in the config. (Verified July 2026.)

Read the chosen corpus and write `00_admin/style-profile.md` covering, with examples quoted from it:

- Sentence length and paragraph density; use of topic sentences
- Voice (active/passive ratio), person ("we" vs. impersonal), tense conventions
- Hedging habits ("may," "suggests") vs. assertive claims
- Transition and signposting style; use of bold/italic emphasis
- Terminology preferences and field-specific phrasing
- Figure caption style

Drafting skills recapitulate this profile. If no samples are provided, note that the profile is absent and drafting will use standard scientific register until samples arrive.

## Step 5 — Write project-config.md

First, record which suite version is shaping this application: read `version` from the installed grant-writing plugin's `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (the plugin directory two levels above this skill's folder). If it cannot be located, record `unknown` — never guess. This matters most long after submission: a revision a year later can check what methodology version the original was written under, and the repository's git tags let anyone retrieve that exact version.

Create `00_admin/project-config.md`:

```markdown
# Project Config — <short name>
- Suite version: grant-writing <X.Y.Z> (recorded <YYYY-MM-DD>)
- Suite version history: none   # appended on upgrade: "<old> → <new> on <date> — <context, e.g. mid-draft, resubmission>"
- Session-start rule: compare the installed grant-writing plugin version (its .claude-plugin/plugin.json) against Suite version above; if different, update it, append the change to the history line, and add a decision-log entry
- Funder / mechanism / FOA: ...
- Award type: research | career-development | fellowship   # K/CAREER/foundation career; F30/F31/F32/GRFP
- New submission | resubmission
- Due dates: sponsor ... / internal grants-office ... / LOI-pre-app ...
- Submission system + submitting official: ...
- Document format: Word | LaTeX
- Reference manager: Zotero | EndNote | Mendeley | BibTeX (.bib) | none yet
- Citation placeholder convention: ...   # how the PI marks to-be-added citations, e.g. "(PMID: <id>)", "(ref)"
- Storage: local | Google Drive | OneDrive | GitHub repo <URL, private, edit workflow>
- Excluded from repo (git mode): 03_budget/ at <location>, 99_prior_grants/ at <location>
- Team: ...
- Page limits: ...         # from FOA summary
- Target study section / IC: ...   # decide early — shapes the writing; grant-cover-letter-assignment finalizes the request
- Budget cap / type: ...   # modular vs detailed, direct cost cap
- Versioning: filename schema | git (commits + status tags)
- Tone rules: neutral scientific register, no flattery, strengths/weaknesses stated factually
- Text flow: refine interactively in conversation; only user-approved text enters documents
- Checklist: 00_admin/<checklist file> (office-provided | auto-generated)
- Style profile: 00_admin/style-profile.md (present | pending)
- Style corpus source: published papers | public grant text | prior/unpublished grants | none yet   # note any confidentiality constraint the PI raised
- Open items: ...
```

Also create an empty `00_admin/decision-log.md` and — in filename mode only — `00_admin/version-log.md`.

## Step 6 — Confirm and hand off

Summarize what was created, list open items (missing FOA details, unconfirmed checklist, empty style corpus), and state the natural next step: drafting the Specific Aims (`grant-specific-aims`) — or for NSF, the Project Summary skeleton. For career-development awards, `grant-career-plan` starts alongside the aims: mentors and referees need the most lead time of anything in the application.
